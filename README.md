## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/30/000000/task--v1.png"/> What is Scaling?
Scaling is a way to administrate all the processes in the CPU. It controlls the change between the execution of the processes.

* Burst Time: Quantity of the duration needed for a process.
* Turn Around Time: Interval that the process arrived and it was concluded.
* Waiting Time: Time that the process is in the ready state.
* Context Switching: store the state of a process so that it can be reloaded when required and execution can be resumed from the same point as earlier.
* Average Turn Around Time: is the average turn around time of the algorithm.
* Average Waiting Time: is the average waiting time of the algorithm.

Round-Robin is a scheduling algorithm that consists of dividing the CPU usage time (Central Processing Unit). Each process receives a time slice, this time is called Quantum. The processes are all stored in circular Queue (Buffer).
